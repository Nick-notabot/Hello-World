# Hello-World
This repository is for practicing the Github flow and may be talk to others, if I learn how.-

Hey there! Nick here. I hope you are having a nice day.

I'm here trying to reconnect with some old knowledge about programming and catch up with all the changes of the last years.
I have some... contrasted interests: I love to organize data and phisical things, help other people drives me to study for nursing, a lovely field! 
Anyway, in the last year of my carrer I noticed that I love more the knowledge and the concepts than the practice in the real conditions.
So here I am, trying to re-start my studies in this area while finish my nursing career, hopping to find some project to merge these two fields!

Well, that's all for now, perhaps later I'll make a short-story about my interests (?) 

Would be nice if you want to talk or give me some tips about start in GitHub, or simply share some useful nursing knowledge!

Thank you for read this one!
Have a great day!
Nick.-
